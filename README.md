# Hello-World for Gencyber

Gencyber is a free, two-week camp where students and teachers will dive deep into Cybersecurity and the Internet of Things. Students and teachers will get to IoT apps, break them to learn about the security vulnerabilities, and then tweak them to make them safer and more secure. 

Students will gain the opportunity to speak with security professionals, explore cybersecurity careers, and learn applicable skills.

Teachers will not only experience the fun, hands-on, IoT and cybersecurity activities that students will do, but also get a chance to make IoT and cybersecurity curricula of their own. You'll have expert cybersecurity instructors on hand to help you translate what you learn at camp into your own classrooms.
